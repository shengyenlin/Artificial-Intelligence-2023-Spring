# Artificial intelligence, Spring 2023

This course is a graduate-level artificial intelligence course completely taught in English. This course provide a broad understanding of basic techniques for building intelligent computer systems and an understanding of how AI is applied to problems. The students will learn the theory, algorithms, and their applications.

This repo contains my solutions to the homework as well as the final project.
